# ChessGame
Made with IntelliJ. This fork add new funcionalities to the original ChessGame.

-pieces are no longer all equal and moving rules are applied
-now castle is possible
-after capturing one king the game ends with a victory
-after capturing every piece but both kings the game ends with a draw
-after 50 consecutive moves without any capture from any play the game ends with a draw
-is possible to change side with the board (with up black down & black up with down)
-is possible to change color of the chessboard, right now only two options are avaiable
